    <h1>Sunflower</h1>

    <h4>The common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a large annual forb of the genus Helianthus. It is commonly grown as a crop for its edible oily seeds.</h4>
    
    <p>Apart from cooking oil production, it is also used as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant), as bird food, in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens. Wild H. annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched stem.</p>

    <p>The binomial name Helianthus annuus is derived from the Greek Helios 'sun' and anthos 'flower', while the epithet annuus means 'annual' in Latin.</p>
